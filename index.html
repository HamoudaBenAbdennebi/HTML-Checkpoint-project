      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
      <p>
        A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software
        engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and
        evaluation of computer software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the mid-1970s, software practitioners generally called
        themselves computer scientists, computer programmers or software
        developers, regardless of their actual jobs. Many people prefer to call
        themselves software developer and programmer, because most widely agree
        what these terms mean, while the exact meaning of software engineer is
        still being debated.

      <h3>Employment</h3>
      <p>
        Most software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software
        engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or
        military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work on
        their own as consulting software engineers. Some organizations have
        specialists to perform all of the tasks in the software development
        process. Other organizations separate software engineers based on
        specific software-engineering tasks. These companies sometimes hire
        interns (possibly university or college students) over a short time. In
        large projects, software engineers are distinguished from people who
        specialize in only one role because they take part in the design as well
        as the programming of the project. In small projects, software engineers
        will usually fill several or all roles at the same time. Specializations
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in industry (analysts, architects, developers, testers, technical
          support, managers)
        </li>
        <li>in academia (educators, researchers)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Impact of globalization</h3>
      <p>
        Most students in the developed world have avoided degrees related to
        software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing
        (importing software products or services from other countries) and of
        being displaced by foreign visa workers. Although government statistics
        do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related
        career, computer programming does appear to have been affected. Often
        one is expected to start out as a computer programmer before being
        promoted to software engineer. Thus, the career path to software
        engineering may be rough, especially during recessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some career counselors suggest a student also focus on "people skills"
        and business skills rather than purely technical skills because such
        "soft skills" are allegedly more difficult to offshore. Reasonable
        command over reading, writing & speaking English is asked by most of
        employers. It is the quasi-management aspects of software engineering
        that appear to be what has kept it from being impacted by globalization.
      </p>
      <h3>Prizes</h3>
      <p>There are several prizes in the field of software engineering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Codie awards is a yearly award issued by the Software and
          Information Industry Association for excellence in software
          development within the software industry.
        </li>
        <li>Jolt Awards are awards in the software industry.</li>
        <li>
          Stevens Award is a software engineering award given in memory of Wayne
          Stevens.
        </li>
      </ul>
